# Android_Movie-search-app
In this application, I have implemented downloading data from the network and loading the downloaded data into RecyclerView.
Implemented 2 options for loading data - page by page (Paging Library) and the entire package.

In the example of downloading the entire package with data, there is an option to download movies for the selected year and month.
There is also a built-in filter that allows you to leave on the screen only those films that were made in Russia!

# Technology stack:
